    aboutMe: `Actually, the term role model means any person whose do the same or emulated whose behavior. It has many kinds such as ideas, behavior or action of any person. Role model also has a strong effect on what a person decides to become in the future. Unfortunately, my role model is Bruce lee. I tried my best to study his martial art for prevent myself and I remembered the first thing he said that “knowing is not enough we must to apply. Willing is not enough we must do”. Although I have knowledge I should be try to do it. Even, it’s not so well, but it is my willing that I completed. One more thing that I like from him is “If you love life, don't waste time, for time is what life is made up of.” I really support this idea. I should be created a new purpose in my life. The last one of my role model in the future is Jack Ma. He is a Chinese business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. Nowadays, he is a co-founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group. He tried to study English language until he know the internet working, so he can make team to create the technology like the business website. For me I really want to make my own business too. I would be know about my skill course to create a website. Specially, make a good relationship with my team and customer.`,
